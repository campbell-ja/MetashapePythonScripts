# MetashapePythonScripts
Set of Python scripts for use with Agisoft Metashape. 

The scripts held within this repository are meant as a learning tool. 

*"Single Action"* Scripts covers a single action and when combined it is possible to create a full workflow from project creation to the final output of a 3D model.

*"Workflow - In the Round"* Scripts are a complete processing workflow where multiple single action scripts have been combined into relevant parts. 

**Note** The settings and variable values held within each script generally run the action at the highest quality level. Please be aware of this and make any changes you may need to match your processing hardware.
